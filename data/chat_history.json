      "message": "Great question! Let me help you understand this step by step.\n\n**THOUGHT:** The student is asking about a fundamental trigonometric value. This is a perfect opportunity to connect the unit circle concept with special triangles.\n\n**ACTION:** I'll guide them through the 30-60-90 triangle approach to find sin(30°).\n\nThe sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 or 0.5. Here's how we can understand this:\n\n1) In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2\n2) For the 30° angle, the opposite side is 1 and the hypotenuse is 2\n3) Since sin = opposite/hypotenuse, we get sin(30°) = 1/2\n\nCan you try to find cos(30°) using the same triangle?"

      "message": "**THOUGHT:** Excellent! The student correctly identified the adjacent side and applied the cosine ratio. They're demonstrating good understanding of the relationship between triangle sides and trig ratios.\n\n**ACTION:** I'll confirm their answer and build on this success to explore the relationship between sin and cos.\n\nExcellent work! Yes, cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nYou correctly identified that:\n- Adjacent side = √3\n- Hypotenuse = 2\n- So cos(30°) = adjacent/hypotenuse = √3/2\n\nNotice something interesting: sin²(30°) + cos²(30°) = (1/2)² + (√3/2)² = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1\n\nThis demonstrates the Pythagorean identity! Can you guess what sin(60°) might be?"

      "message": "To find the tangent of 45 degrees, you can use the fact that in a 45-45-90 triangle (an isosceles right triangle), both legs are equal in length.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1. In a 45-45-90 triangle, if each leg has length 1, then:\n   - Opposite side = 1\n   - Adjacent side = 1\n   - Hypotenuse = √2\n\n2. Since tangent = opposite/adjacent:\n   tan(45°) = 1/1 = 1\n\nSo tan(45°) = 1, which means the angle creates a slope of 1 (45-degree angle from horizontal).\n\nThis is one of the most common trigonometric values to remember: tan(45°) = 1.\n\nWould you like to explore other common angles like 30° or 60°?"
