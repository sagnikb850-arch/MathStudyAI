This is a perfect opportunity to connect the unit circle concept with special triangles.\n\n**ACTION:** I'll guide them through the 30-60-90 triangle approach to find sin(30°).\n\nThe sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 or 0.5. Here's how we can understand this:\n\n1) In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2\n2) For the 30° angle, the opposite side is 1 and the hypotenuse is 2\n3) Since sin = opposite/hypotenuse, we get sin(30°) = 1/2\n\nCan you try to find cos(30°) using the same triangle?",

They seem to be at the beginning of learning trigonometric values. I should use the 30-60-90 triangle to make this concrete and visual, then guide them to discover cos(30°) as well.\n\n**THOUGHT:** The student is asking about a fundamental trigonometric value.

They're demonstrating good understanding of the relationship between triangle sides and trig ratios.\n\n**ACTION:** I'll confirm their answer and build on this success to explore the relationship between sin and cos.\n\nExcellent work! Yes, cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nYou correctly identified that:\n- Adjacent side = √3\n- Hypotenuse = 2\n- So cos(30°) = adjacent/hypotenuse = √3/2\n\nNotice something interesting: sin²(30°) + cos²(30°) = (1/2)² + (√3/2)² = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1\n\nThis demonstrates the Pythagorean identity! Can you guess what sin(60°) might be?",
      "tutor_response_full": "**OBSERVATION:** Excellent response from the student! They correctly applied the cosine ratio and identified √3 as the adjacent side. This shows they understand the SOH-CAH-TOA relationships and can visualize the 30-60-90 triangle. This is the perfect moment to introduce the Pythagorean identity and connect it to complementary angles.\n\n**THOUGHT:** Excellent!
